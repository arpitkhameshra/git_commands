Git & Github -
Git is Version Control System which allows you to track version history of your files 
 
#git is an example of VCS (Version Control System) & github is an example of DVCS (Distributed Version Control System)

git init (Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory by creating a .git directory.)
git add (Adds files or changes to the staging area for the next commit)
git commit -m (Saves changes from the staging area to the repository with a message describing the changes.)
git log (Displays the commit history in detail)
git log --oneline --pretty (Shows the commit history in a simplified, readable format)
git log --oneline (Shows each commit in a single-line format)
git restore (to undo changes/Reverts changes in the working directory)
git rm --cached (to remove file from repository not from file system (staging to untracked))
git config --global user.name "" (Sets the global Git username for commits)
git config --global user.email "" (Sets the global Git email address for commits)
git checkout -b (Creates a new branch and switches to it)
git checkout <branch-name> (switch to branch)
git status (Displays the current status of the repository)
git branch (Lists all branches and highlights the current branch)
git restore --source otherbranch /path (Restores files or directories from another branch)
git clone (Creates a local copy of a remote repository)
git remote -v (Displays the remote repository URLs.)
git pull (to get github changes to local for that  branch )
git fetch (for get all github branches changes to local)
git push (for share local changes to github)  #if push file not set then go to config file and edit
git remote set-url --add origin <https://token key@remaining url>
git remote set-url --delete origin <url>
git revert <commit id> (for revert that particular commit and it maintain its version hitory)
git reset <commit id> (for reset that particular commit and it doesn't maintain its version hisory)
git merge <branch-name> (it merges both branches not maintain linear version history)
git branch -D <branch-name> (it delete the branch)
git pull origin <branch-name> rebase (it like merge but maintain a linear commit history)
git stash (use for not commiting the pending work and not want to show to someone)
git stash pop (to resume your pending work after stashing)
git cherry-pick <commit-id> (it pick that perticular commit from branch and applying it to another) 

git clone vs git fork 

git fork - A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to make your own changes without impacting the original project. (because all changes done in own repository)
git clone - When you clone a repository you are creating a local copy on your computer that you can sync with the remote on GitHub (it impact the original project)
